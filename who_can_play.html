<h1>Who Can Play?</h1>

<p>
    There are 800 million players worldwide who play volleyball at least once a week.
    Volleyball is a sport that is safe, fun and does not require extreme fitness.
    Since you don’t have to move around the court too much, it’s great for people who want a low-impact sport that will help them get fit without pushing them to their limit. For those who are a bit more competitive, the sport is fantastic because games can be really exciting and intense, but there’s always a net between you and your opponents.
    Beach volleyball is <em>suitable for people of all ages</em>, and men and women alike.
